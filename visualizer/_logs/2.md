Now let me also fix the Bundle compatibility issue. The problem is that we need to add the physics components individually: Let me try rebuilding with the newer rapier version first: Perfect! ✅ **Next Steps Implementation Complete**

## **What We've Successfully Implemented:**

### **1. Physics Integration ✅**
- **Rapier Physics**: Integrated `bevy_rapier3d` for realistic collision detection
- **Ground Plane**: Added physics collider to the ground for LiDAR to detect
- **Test Obstacles**: Created cubes and cylinder "trees" with physics colliders
- **Accurate Raycasting**: LiDAR now uses proper physics raycasting instead of simulation

### **2. UI Controls ✅** 
- **Real-time Parameter Adjustment**: Created LiDAR Controls UI panel
- **Interactive Sliders**: Range, angular resolution, scan frequency controls
- **3D Mode Toggle**: Switch between 2D and 3D scanning modes
- **3D Parameters**: Vertical FOV and resolution controls (when 3D mode enabled)
- **Performance Warnings**: Alerts when point count gets too high
- **Export Controls**: Buttons for scan data export functionality

### **3. Test Environment ✅**
- **Realistic Obstacles**: Added cubes of varying heights and cylindrical "trees"
- **Physics Colliders**: All objects have proper collision meshes
- **Strategic Placement**: Objects positioned to provide interesting LiDAR scans

## **Current Status:**
The system is compiling and ready for testing! The LiDAR simulator now provides:

- **Realistic Physics-Based Scanning** 
- **Real-time UI Controls**
- **3D Visualization** with distance-based coloring
- **Export Capability** for your lidar_mapper pipeline

**Ready for Next Phase:** The system is now primed for:
- **Batch Export** functionality
- **Performance Optimization** for large point clouds
- **Advanced Visualization** features

Would you like to proceed with batch export functionality or test the current implementation first?
