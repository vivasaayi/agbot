# Resume — field-intel-run-1

Refactor: AGBot → layered field-intelligence pipeline.
Plan: /Users/rajanpanneerselvam/Docs/AGBOT/refactor.md (reviewed + expanded 2026-07-03).

- Branch: field-intelligence-pipeline. Main: main.
- Two tracks (see plan §"Implementation Sequencing"):
  - Track A (data backbone): TA-01 … TA-10.
  - Track B (consumption): Phase A web (TB-A1..A7), B apps, C alerting, D proposals, E dispatch.

## Progress
- TA-01 committed (250e8dd): `shared/src/product_graph.rs` contract types + tests.
- TB-A1 committed (47f6f10): `/workspace` static serving via ServeDir; web shell +
  api.js + app.js; workspace_web_root config; route-manifest test (3 pass).
- TA-02 committed (5bf8306): catalog schema (catalog_sources/products/
  product_inputs/provenance_evidence, additive) + `geo_hub/src/catalog.rs`
  registry (register_product, get/list/trace_inputs/supersede);
  `tests/catalog_registry.rs` 9 pass. Identity = (kind, parameters_hash); scope
  is NOT identity (pinned by test).
- TA-03 committed (d417463): `geo_hub/src/provenance_store.rs` (append_lineage
  in-tx, load_all, trace_backward/forward). register_product writes lineage in
  the same transaction (SystemService default) + stamps provenance_id.
  GET /api/provenance/trace/:artifact_id. `tests/provenance_ledger.rs` 5 pass.

Track A critical path 1->2->3 done. Batches 4 || 5 can now run in parallel.

## Known-red (user decision: proceed, track separately)
~15 geo_hub products_api acceptance tests (farm/field CRUD, shapefile, geojson)
return 500 on main and every commit — PRE-EXISTING, unrelated to refactor. Not a
gate. Per-batch verification uses targeted tests + the batch's own test file.

## Next action
TA-04: backfill `products` -> `catalog_products` + make `publish_product`
dual-write into the catalog; legacy tile/serving routes must stay unaffected.
See geo_hub/src/product_catalog.rs (publish_product / publish_georeferenced_product)
and the `products` table (db.rs:241, UNIQUE(scene_id, kind)). TDD-first;
after landing run the geo_hub tile/products serving tests (not the known-red set).
TA-05 (satellite ingest normalization via ingest_contract.rs) may run in parallel.

## Resume protocol
Read CLAUDE.md + this file + checkpoint.sqlite. Verify `git status --short`,
last commit, roadmap file unchanged. Continue from runs.next_action.
Checkpoint DB is source of truth; the world-sim-run-1 row is a prior unrelated run.
