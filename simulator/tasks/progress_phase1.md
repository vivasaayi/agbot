# Progress Update - Phase 1: Foundation & Menu System

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### Task 1.1: Accurate lat/lon to meters conversion âœ…
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Details**: 
  - Implemented WGS84-accurate coordinate conversion
  - Added meters_per_degree calculations accounting for latitude
  - Buildings and roads now spawn at realistic scale (1 unit = 1 meter)
  - Added proper bounding box calculation for buildings
  - Roads render with realistic length and 5m width

### Task 1.2: Implement main menu system âœ… 
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Details**:
  - Created `AppMode` state enum (MainMenu, Globe, Map2D, Simulation3D)
  - Implemented main menu with mode selection buttons
  - Added navigation bar for quick mode switching
  - Created debug info panel with toggle
  - Added keyboard shortcuts (Esc, Tab, Ctrl+1-4)

### Task 1.3: Create app state management âœ…
- **Status**: COMPLETED  
- **Details**:
  - Added `SelectedRegion` resource for coordinate tracking
  - Created `UIState` resource for user preferences
  - Added `DataLoadingState` resource for progress tracking
  - Integrated Bevy States for clean mode transitions

### Task 1.4: Design and implement navigation UI components âœ…
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Details**:
  - Main menu with region info and mode buttons
  - Top navigation bar with current mode and coordinates
  - Debug info window with FPS and controls
  - Loading progress indicator (ready for data fetching)
  - Keyboard shortcuts and tooltips

## ðŸš§ In Progress

### Task 1.5: Add smooth transitions between modes
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Next Steps**:
  - Add camera transition animations
  - Implement fade effects between modes
  - Add mode-specific setup/teardown

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Phase Ready

**Phase 1 Progress**: 80% Complete (4/5 tasks done)

The foundation is solid! We now have:
- âœ… Real-world accurate coordinate system
- âœ… Clean state management architecture  
- âœ… Intuitive menu and navigation system
- âœ… Debug tools and keyboard shortcuts

**Ready to start Phase 2**: Globe View & Region Selection

## ðŸ§ª Testing Instructions

1. **Run the simulator**: `cargo run`
2. **Test navigation**: 
   - Use menu buttons to switch between modes
   - Try keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+1,2,3,4)
   - Press Tab to toggle debug info
   - Press Esc to return to main menu
3. **Verify 3D simulation**: 
   - Switch to "3D Simulation" mode
   - Should see realistic-scale buildings and roads from GeoJSON
   - Buildings are red, roads are blue

---

## ðŸ”§ Architecture Notes

- **Clean separation**: Each mode is handled by separate systems
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new modes or features
- **Performant**: Only active mode systems run
- **User-friendly**: Consistent navigation patterns

The foundation is ready for the globe view implementation!
