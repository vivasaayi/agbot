## 🎯 Architecture Implemented

**Globe View Components:**
- ✅ `Globe` component for Earth sphere entity
- ✅ `GlobeCamera` component for dedicated globe camera
- ✅ `GlobeState` resource for rotation/zoom state
- ✅ Mouse interaction systems (rotate, zoom, click)
- ✅ Ray-casting for surface selection
- ✅ UI overlays for controls and coordinates

**Integration:**
- ✅ Clean mode transitions (setup/cleanup systems)
- ✅ State management with proper resource handling
- ✅ Coordinate system integration with SelectedRegion
- ✅ UI consistency with main navigation bar

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

1. **Run the simulator**: `cargo run`
2. **Test globe navigation**: 
   - Main Menu → "🌍 Globe View"
   - Drag mouse to rotate Earth
   - Scroll to zoom in/out
   - Click anywhere on Earth surface
3. **Verify coordinates**: 
   - Check coordinate window updates on click
   - Verify lat/lon values are reasonable (-90 to 90°, -180 to 180°)
4. **Test UI**: 
   - Try quick location buttons
   - Toggle coordinate display (C key)
   - Use navigation bar to switch modes
