# Sprint 2: Enhanced World Exploration & Simulation Platform

## Overview
Transform the AgBot Visualizer into a comprehensive world exploration and simulation platform with 2D/3D navigation, city search, OpenStreetMap integration, and multi-vehicle simulation support.

## Sprint Goals
1. Redesigned UI with 2D/3D world exploration options
2. City search and marker placement functionality
3. OpenStreetMap integration for detailed world loading
4. Multi-simulation support (Drone, Tractor, Car)
5. Mac keyboard navigation support
6. Seamless view switching (Top-down, 3D)

## Sprint Duration
**Estimated:** 2-3 weeks  
**Start Date:** July 27, 2025  
**Target End Date:** August 17, 2025

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: UI Redesign & Navigation (Week 1)
- [ ] Simplified main menu with 2D/3D options
- [ ] Clean startup with blank screen + menu
- [ ] State management for world exploration modes
- [ ] Basic navigation between screens

### Milestone 2: World Exploration Features (Week 1-2)
- [ ] 3D globe with city search and markers
- [ ] 2D map with city search and markers
- [ ] Location database and search functionality
- [ ] Smooth transitions and camera controls

### Milestone 3: World Loading & OSM Integration (Week 2)
- [ ] OpenStreetMap API integration
- [ ] 1km² world loading system
- [ ] Building and tree rendering
- [ ] Top-down and 3D view switching

### Milestone 4: Simulation Framework (Week 2-3)
- [ ] Multi-vehicle simulation architecture
- [ ] Drone, Tractor, Car simulation options
- [ ] Simulation selection UI
- [ ] Mac keyboard controls

### Milestone 5: Polish & Integration (Week 3)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Error handling and validation
- [ ] Documentation and testing
- [ ] Final integration testing

## Architecture Changes

### New State Flow
```
Startup → MainMenu → [3DWorld|2DWorld] → CitySearch → WorldLoading → Simulation
```

### New Modules
- `world_exploration/` - 2D/3D world navigation
- `city_search/` - Location search and markers  
- `osm_integration/` - OpenStreetMap data loading
- `simulation_selection/` - Multi-vehicle simulation
- `world_loading/` - Detailed world rendering
- `camera_controls/` - Mac keyboard navigation

## Dependencies
- `reqwest` - HTTP client for OSM API
- `serde_json` - JSON parsing for OSM data
- `geo` - Geospatial calculations
- `osm-reader` - OpenStreetMap data parsing

## Success Criteria
✅ User can start with clean main menu  
✅ Seamless 2D/3D world exploration  
✅ City search with visual markers  
✅ 1km² world loading from OSM  
✅ Multi-vehicle simulation selection  
✅ Smooth Mac keyboard navigation  
✅ Performance maintains 60+ FPS  

## Risk Mitigation
- **OSM API Rate Limits:** Implement caching and batch requests
- **Performance:** Use LOD (Level of Detail) for large worlds
- **Memory Usage:** Stream world data as needed
- **Complexity:** Modular architecture with clear interfaces
