# Task 04: OpenStreetMap Integration & World Loading

## Objective
Implement OpenStreetMap API integration to fetch detailed geographic data for a 1kmÂ² area around the selected location, including buildings, roads, trees, and other features for realistic world rendering.

## Requirements
1. **OSM Data Fetching**
   - Query OpenStreetMap Overpass API for 1kmÂ² area
   - Fetch buildings, roads, trees, water bodies, and other features
   - Handle API rate limits and error conditions

2. **Data Processing**
   - Parse OSM data into usable format
   - Convert geographical coordinates to world coordinates
   - Process building heights and shapes
   - Identify vegetation and terrain features

3. **World Generation**
   - Generate 3D buildings from OSM building data
   - Create road networks with proper widths
   - Place trees and vegetation based on landuse data
   - Generate terrain mesh for the area

4. **View Switching**
   - Default to top-down view for validation
   - Toggle between top-down and 3D perspective
   - Smooth camera transitions between views

## Technical Tasks

### 1. OSM API Integration
**File:** `src/osm_integration/overpass_client.rs` (new)
- [ ] Implement Overpass API client
- [ ] Create query builder for area data
- [ ] Handle API responses and errors
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and retries

### 2. Data Models
**File:** `src/osm_integration/osm_data.rs` (new)
- [ ] Define OSM data structures
- [ ] Building, road, tree, water body models
- [ ] Coordinate conversion utilities
- [ ] Data validation and sanitization

### 3. World Generator
**File:** `src/world_loading/world_generator.rs` (new)
- [ ] Convert OSM data to 3D world
- [ ] Building mesh generation
- [ ] Road network creation
- [ ] Vegetation placement system

### 4. Building Renderer
**File:** `src/world_loading/building_renderer.rs` (new)
- [ ] Create 3D building meshes from OSM polygons
- [ ] Apply realistic building heights
- [ ] Add building materials and textures
- [ ] Handle complex building shapes

### 5. Road System
**File:** `src/world_loading/road_system.rs` (new)
- [ ] Generate road meshes from OSM ways
- [ ] Apply road widths and types
- [ ] Create intersections and junctions
- [ ] Add road markings and signs

### 6. Vegetation System
**File:** `src/world_loading/vegetation.rs` (new)
- [ ] Place trees based on OSM data
- [ ] Add variety in tree models
- [ ] Create grass and vegetation areas
- [ ] Handle parks and green spaces

### 7. Camera View Controller
**File:** `src/world_loading/view_controller.rs` (new)
- [ ] Top-down view implementation (default)
- [ ] 3D perspective view
- [ ] Smooth transitions between views
- [ ] View validation and testing modes

### 8. Loading State Handler
**File:** `src/world_loading/loading_state.rs` (new)
- [ ] Handle WorldLoading state
- [ ] Progress tracking for world generation
- [ ] Error handling and fallbacks
- [ ] Transition to Simulation state

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Load button fetches 1kmÂ² OSM data for selected location
- [ ] Buildings are rendered as 3D meshes with realistic heights
- [ ] Roads are properly generated with correct widths
- [ ] Trees and vegetation are placed based on landuse data
- [ ] World loads in top-down view by default for validation
- [ ] User can toggle between top-down and 3D views
- [ ] Loading process shows progress indicator
- [ ] Error handling for network failures and invalid data

## OSM Query Details
```overpass
[out:json][timeout:25];
(
  way["building"](bbox);
  way["highway"](bbox);
  way["natural"="tree"](bbox);
  way["landuse"](bbox);
  way["waterway"](bbox);
  relation["building"](bbox);
);
out geom;
```

## Implementation Notes
- Use 1km Ã— 1km bounding box around selected coordinates
- Implement caching to avoid repeated API calls
- Use Level of Detail (LOD) for performance optimization
- Consider using background loading for better UX

## Dependencies to Add
```toml
[dependencies]
reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["json"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
geo = "0.27"
```

## Estimated Time
**16 hours**

## Dependencies
- Task 02 or Task 03 (world exploration) must be completed
- Network connectivity for OSM API

## Testing
- [ ] Test with various city locations
- [ ] Verify building placement accuracy
- [ ] Test road network generation
- [ ] Validate coordinate conversions
- [ ] Performance testing with complex areas
- [ ] Test error handling for API failures
- [ ] Verify top-down view shows correct layout
