## Risk Monitoring

### High Risk Areas
- **OSM API Integration:** Complex data parsing and rate limits
- **Performance:** Maintaining 60+ FPS with detailed worlds
- **Mac Compatibility:** Ensuring all controls work properly

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with simple OSM queries and expand
- Implement LOD early in development
- Test on actual Mac hardware frequently
